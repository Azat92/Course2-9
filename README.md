Objective-C blocks

This is a demo project for Objective-C blocks. Here you can find main blocks syntax and learn blocks in an example 
of recursive merge sort implementation as well as some iOS classes categories.

This is also a starter project for implementing a category for `UIPageViewController` that allows to show new
instance of `UIPageViewController` with block callback for controllers change event. Also you will need to
implement some new class that will simulate fetching some random number and return result via block. That class
will be used to populate `UITableViewController`s in the `UIPageViewController`. And finally, you will need a 
category for `UITableViewController` that will allow to listen in a callback cell selection and in that block you
should replace row text with some random string.
